            <h3>First Paragraph</h3>
            <p>The Most famous application of iPhone is “SIRI” which helps 
                the end user to communicate end user mobile with voice and it
                 also responds to the voice commands of the user. Same kind
                  of application is also developed by the Google that is “Google Voice Search”
                   which is used for in Android Phones. 
                   But this Application mostly works with Internet Connections. 
                   But our Proposed System has capability to work with and without
                    Internet Connectivity. It is named as Personal Assistant with Voice 
                    Recognition Intelligence, which takes the user input in form of voice or
                     text and process it and returns the output in various forms like action
                      to be performed or the search result is dictated to the end user. 
                      In addition, this proposed system can change the way of interactions 
                      between end user and the mobile devices. The system is being designed in such 
                      a way that all the services provided by the mobile devices are accessible by the
                       end user on the user's voice commands.

            <h3>Second Paragraph</h3>
            <p>Cyber System Project are developed for café owner to protect the
                 cybercrime of other users they can used that café systems for crime.
                  Many user can enter the café a day. That time we are not capable to 
                  remember every one. When user  used system to get crime and then go
                   their place before that time the system are they are start system 
                   get their snap and time . Then owner are capable to show their picture to 
                   the cybercrime department. We are also used in this project voice based 
                   intelligent with the used of artificial Intelligent. Artificial intelligence
                    (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that is capturing the 
                    attention of commercial investors, defence intellectuals, policymakers, 
                    and international competitors 
                alike, as evidenced by a number of recent initiatives.
